we want to desgin a top-down right-to-left prser

in lines 3 to 15, we give desired grammer to the program, and then, ask it to show us the  given grammer.

in line 19, we give the sentence that we want to see if it belongs to the given grammer or not. 

Then, we continue the parsing operation recursively until we see whether the parser recognizes the given sentence as belonging to the desired grammar or not.
